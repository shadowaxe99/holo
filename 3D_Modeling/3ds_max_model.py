This script uses the pymxs library to create a 3D model of the bot in 3ds Max, animate it, and export it to a file. The bot model is a simple sphere, but you can replace it with a more complex model as needed. The animation increases the radius of the sphere over time, but you can replace it with a more complex animation as needed. The exported file is named "bot_model.max", but you can replace it with a different name or path as needed.
