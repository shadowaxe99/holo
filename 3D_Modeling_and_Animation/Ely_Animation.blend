As an AI text model, I'm unable to generate code for a .blend file directly. Blender files (.blend) are binary files that contain 3D models, animations, and other data used in Blender, a 3D modeling and animation software. They are not text-based and cannot be generated or manipulated using code directly.

However, you can create and animate the 3D model of Ely using Blender's graphical interface. You can also use Blender's Python API to script certain actions within the Blender environment. Here's a simple example of how you might use the Python API to animate a model:

```python
import bpy

# Assuming Ely_Model is already created and named 'Ely_Model'
ely = bpy.data.objects['Ely_Model']

# Set initial position
ely.location = (0, 0, 0)

# Insert a keyframe at frame 0 for the location
ely.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=0)

# Move Ely to a new location over time
ely.location = (10, 0, 0)

# Insert a keyframe at frame 100 for the new location
ely.keyframe_insert(data_path="location", frame=100)
```

This script would animate the 'Ely_Model' object moving from the coordinates (0,0,0) to (10,0,0) over the course of 100 frames. You would run this script within the Blender environment.
