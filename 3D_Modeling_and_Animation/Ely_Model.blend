As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate a 3D model directly. However, I can provide a pseudo-code that outlines the steps you would take to create a 3D model of Ely in a software like Blender. 

```python
# Pseudo-code for creating a 3D model in Blender

# Import necessary Blender Python (bpy) module
import bpy

# Create a new mesh object with the name 'Ely_Model'
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(location=(0, 0, 0))

# Set the object as the active object
ely_model = bpy.context.active_object

# Rename the object
ely_model.name = "Ely_Model"

# Set the color of the model to blue
ely_model.data.materials.append(bpy.data.materials.new(name="Blue_Material"))
ely_model.data.materials[0].diffuse_color = (0, 0, 1, 1)  # RGB and alpha

# Add details to the model to make it look like an alien figure
# This will involve sculpting, adding textures, and other modeling techniques
# which are beyond the scope of this pseudo-code

# Save the model
bpy.ops.wm.save_as_mainfile(filepath="3D_Modeling_and_Animation/Ely_Model.blend")
```

Please note that this is a simplified pseudo-code and creating a detailed 3D model like Ely would involve more complex modeling techniques. Also, Blender's Python API (bpy) is mostly used for automating tasks and creating tools, not for creating models from scratch. The actual modeling is usually done manually using Blender's user interface.
