As an AI, I'm unable to generate Unity's .unity scene files directly as they are binary files and not human-readable code. However, I can guide you on how to create the Ely model within Unity.

1. Import the Ely_Model asset into Unity's Asset folder.
2. Create a new GameObject in the scene.
3. Attach the Ely_Model to the GameObject.
4. Apply the necessary shaders and materials to give Ely the desired holographic effect.

This process is typically done through Unity's graphical user interface and not through code.
