As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to generate code for a .blend file, which is a binary file type used by Blender for 3D modeling. The creation of a holographic effect in Blender involves a series of graphical manipulations and settings adjustments, which can't be represented as text-based code. 

You would typically create a holographic effect in Blender by adjusting material properties, using nodes, and applying certain textures and shaders. This process is interactive and visual, and it's done through the Blender's user interface. 

I recommend referring to Blender's official documentation or relevant tutorials for creating holographic effects.
