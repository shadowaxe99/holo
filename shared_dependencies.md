Shared Dependencies:

1. **3D Model Data**: The 3D model data created in "blender_model.py", "maya_model.py", and "3ds_max_model.py" will be shared across "visual_effects.py" for applying holographic effects and "integration_script.py" for integrating all components.

2. **NLP Model**: The GPT model created in "gpt_model.py" will be used in "google_speech_to_text.py" to convert the recognized speech into text, and in "google_text_to_speech.py" to convert the generated text into speech. It will also be used in "integration_script.py" to integrate all components.

3. **Speech Data**: The speech data recognized in "google_speech_to_text.py" will be used in "gpt_model.py" to generate responses and in "integration_script.py" for integration.

4. **Generated Text**: The text generated in "gpt_model.py" will be used in "google_text_to_speech.py" to convert it into speech and in "integration_script.py" for integration.

5. **Generated Speech**: The speech synthesized in "google_text_to_speech.py" will be used in "integration_script.py" for integration.

6. **Test Cases**: The test cases defined in "testing_script.py" will be used across all other scripts for testing purposes.

7. **DOM Elements**: The DOM elements used in the scripts for creating the 3D model, applying visual effects, and displaying the bot on the screen will be shared across all scripts.

8. **Message Names**: The message names used for communication between different components of the bot will be shared across all scripts.

9. **Function Names**: The function names used for creating the 3D model, applying visual effects, processing natural language, recognizing speech, synthesizing speech, integrating components, and testing will be shared across all scripts.
